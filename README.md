### Process Scheduler for Modern Operating Systems

This Java program simulates a process scheduler for modern operating systems with various scheduling algorithms. It supports the following scheduling algorithms:

1. **FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)** - Schedules processes in the order they arrive.
2. **SJF (Shortest Job First)** - Schedules processes with the shortest service time first.
3. **SRT (Shortest Remaining Time)** - Preempts the currently executing process if a shorter one becomes available.
4. **Round Robin (q=2)** - Implements round-robin scheduling with a time quantum of 2 units.
5. **Round Robin (q=4)** - Implements round-robin scheduling with a time quantum of 4 units.
6. **Round Robin (q=8)** - Implements round-robin scheduling with a time quantum of 8 units.
7. **HRRN (Highest Response Ratio Next)** - Schedules processes based on their response ratios.
8. **MLFB (Multi-Level Feedback Queue)** - Simulates a multi-level feedback queue with customizable time slices.
